Alert is an AngularJS-version of bootstrap's alert.

This directive can be used to generate alerts from the dynamic model data (using the `ng-repeat` directive);

The presence of the `close` attribute determines if a close button is displayed.

The optional `dismiss-on-timeout` attribute takes the number of milliseconds that specify timeout duration, after which the alert will be closed.  This attribute requires the presence of the `close` attribute.

The optional `template-url` attribute allows the user to override the default template with a custom template on an instance by instance basis
